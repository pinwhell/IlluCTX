# IllusoryCTX

`IllusoryCTX` is a prototype library designed to enable `cross-address-space threading`, providing developers and researchers with a powerful abstraction layer for advanced low-level programming. Built on top of the `Unicorn Framework`, `IllusoryCTX` leverages dependencies like `SimplisticIO` and `UcPP (Unicorn Engine C++ Wrapper)` to deliver robust functionality.

This tool is ideal for anyone with a solid understanding of low-level systems who are exploring innovative ways to manipulate execution contexts. While it can be used as a standalone tool once dependencies are installed, its library nature allows seamless integration into custom applications.

Currently available as a prototype, `IllusoryCTX` supports flexible modifications to accommodate various architectures, empowering users to extend its capabilities to fit unique use cases.
